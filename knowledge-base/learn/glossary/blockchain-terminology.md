<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Blockchain</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the security, transparency, and immutability of the data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Cryptocurrency</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. Examples include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Luna Classic (LUNC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Decentralization</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The distribution of authority, governance, and functions across a network rather than being managed by a centralized entity. This ensures no single point of control or failure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places simultaneously. Blockchain is a type of DLT.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of a contract when predetermined conditions are met.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. <strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The method used by blockchain networks to agree on the validity of transactions and maintain the integrity of the ledger. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7. <strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A consensus mechanism that requires participants (miners) to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks, ensuring security and preventing double-spending.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8. <strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. This method is more energy-efficient than PoW.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9. <strong>Node</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A computer connected to a blockchain network that participates in the validation and relay of transactions. Nodes can be full (storing the entire blockchain) or light (storing only part of the blockchain).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">10. <strong>Mining</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain ledger. In PoW, this involves solving complex computational problems, while in PoS, it involves staking tokens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">11. <strong>Wallet</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies. Wallets can be software-based (online or mobile apps) or hardware-based (physical devices).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">12. <strong>Private Key</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A secret key used in cryptography that allows users to access their cryptocurrency holdings and authorize transactions. It should be kept secure and never shared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">13. <strong>Public Key</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cryptographic key that can be shared publicly and is used to receive funds. It is mathematically linked to the corresponding private key.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">14. <strong>Decentralized Application (dApp)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An application built on a decentralized network, such as a blockchain, that operates autonomously without a central authority. Examples include DeFi platforms and decentralized exchanges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">15. <strong>DeFi (Decentralized Finance)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A movement that leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to recreate and improve traditional financial systems (like lending, borrowing, and trading) in a decentralized manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">16. <strong>Token</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A digital asset issued on a blockchain that can represent various types of value, including currencies, utilities, or assets. Tokens can be fungible (like cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible (like NFTs).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">17. <strong>ICO (Initial Coin Offering)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A fundraising method used by blockchain projects to raise capital by issuing new tokens to investors in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">18. <strong>Fork</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A split in a blockchain network where the protocol or codebase is changed. Hard forks result in two separate blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash), while soft forks are backward-compatible updates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">19. <strong>Mainnet</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The primary and fully operational blockchain network where actual transactions occur, as opposed to a testnet, which is used for testing and development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">20. <strong>Gas</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A unit of measure for the computational work required to execute transactions and smart contracts on networks like Ethereum. Users pay gas fees to incentivize miners or validators to process their transactions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These definitions should help build a foundational understanding of blockchain terminology for your knowledge base.</p>
